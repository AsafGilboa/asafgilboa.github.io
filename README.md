File size is abnormal - 832314880 (bytes)

The file version - pretends to be Balbolkoa, a text-to-speech program

Reason for file version - to evade antivirus

The bulk of the file is in one section alone, named "DoItInPe", which is marked as RWX and is 98.71% of the total file size.

Another section that stands out is the "ClearedP" section, which has an unusually high entropy score of 7.995.

So ironically, while this file is over 800MB, it is actually packed.
